# python-challenge
This assignment was composed of 2 sections.
 PyBank was the first challenge. It was a simple csv file that was to be opened, looped through to get 
 summary data and create a simple Financial Analysis report.
 
 PyPoll was the second challenge. This was the more difficult of the two. 
  First, because the data consisted of more than 3MM rows of voting result data.
  Looping through the data and calculating the results in terms of a winner as well
  as the percentage of votes each of the candidates received utilized most of what we
  have learned so far in the class. 
  In writing the output of the file, I utilized the sys library to make the printing to 
  a text file much easier than the first exercise by using the print statement to print directly to stdout.
